# Dataset Download and Preparation Instructions

## Overview
To collect historical British Parliament debate transcripts in XML format, I used the `rsync` command-line tool to mirror public data from TheyWorkForYou.com.  
TheyWorkForYou.com provides structured parliamentary data under open terms.

The dataset contains XML files for each parliamentary sitting, organized by date, including debate and content files.
